1. Recovery
This approach checks if deadlock occured, and in the case of deadlock applies some of the recovery methods to the 
system to get rid of deadlock. It deacreases performance, as checks for deadlocks constantly and the work/data could be lost when processes must be aborted or have their resources preempted. 
2. Avoidance
In order to avoid deadlocks, the operating system evaluates whether the system is in a safe or unsafe state at each step. 
The process is repeated until the system is in a safe state. Once the system moves to unsafe state, 
the OS has to backtrack one step. It requires more information 
about each process, AND leads to low device utilization.
3. Prevention
Deadlock happens only when Mutual Exclusion, hold and wait, No preemption and circular wait holds simultaneously. 
By violating one of the four conditions at any time, the deadlock can never occur in the system.

Deadlock Prevention is better than other strategies, as it needs less information about processes. 
The recovery is the most ineffective of all three strategies.
