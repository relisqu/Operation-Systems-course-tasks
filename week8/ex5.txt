The physical address in the address in memory in actual hardware, the virtual address is the address of the program in virtual memory.
The virtual memory can be bigger than physical memory and it doesn't necessary fit into physical memory, so part of virtual memory is stored on the disc.
Because of it we need to translate the virtual address to the physical address first, as we can't use the same adress to access both virtual and physical memory.
Some pages from virtual memory may not be loaded into physical memory so it should be loaded from the disc.
Moreover each program there is not enough memory to keep all the running programs in it so each programm has it's different address space.
